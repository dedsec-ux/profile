independent development , managing full-cycle Flutter projects from
concept to deployment.
WORK EXPERIENCE
Windows LMS
Developed a Windows-based Flutter application, featuring a custom quiz
generation model and integrated plagiarism detection. The system allows
teachers to create and manage quizzes, while students can attempt them online
with results tracked in real time. Built using Flutter , Dart , SupaBase and Firebase ,
the app supports seamless data synchronization, user authentication, and secure
content delivery.
E-commerce Mobile App
Developed a Flutter-based Android application that allows users to upload and
sell items such as clothes, jewelry, and more across multiple categories. The app
enables product browsing, item listing, and order placement. Includes a fully
functional admin panel for managing listings and real-time order tracking .
Skin Cancer Mobile App
Developed a Flutter-based Android application that uses a trained AI model to
help users detect potential skin cancer by analyzing uploaded images. The app
provides preliminary results and allows users to connect with available doctors for
consultation via an in-app chat feature. Includes an admin panel for managing
doctor profiles and viewing user information.
StegoCrypt Mobile App
Developed a Flutter-based steganography app for secure data concealment,
featuring a cyberpunk neon-glitch UI. Implemented AES-GCM encryption, PBKDF2
key derivation, and LSB steganography to embed/decrypt messages in images.
Included three modes, a dynamic splash screen, and a copyable ciphertext
feature.
CURRENT PROJECT
Blocky Hero Saga
Currently developing a 2D arcade-style game using Flutter with the Flame game
engine and Tiled for level design. The game is inspired by Snow Bros , featuring
player controls, enemy interactions, scoring mechanics, and custom-built levels.
